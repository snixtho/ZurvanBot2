# ZurvanBot2
The new and better ZurvanBot (used to be a private project.).
The previous and untold version used to be coded in python and used library
for the discord client. This version however, is now coded in c# and has
a custom implementation for the Discord API.

#### Dependencies:
- Newtonsoft Json.NET (For json parsing)
- WebSocketSharp (For the websockets client)

#### NOTE: Under very early development and is super unstable and does not implement all required features yet, so do not use it for production.

### Current State
Just trying to get everything working, with a somewhat messy code. Which will be cleaned up later.
